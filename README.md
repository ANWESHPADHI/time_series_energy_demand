# Energy Demand Prediction in Switzerland

## What is it?
This repository contains the code for the blog post 'TITLE HERE' [LINK HERE] where we use the Python time series library giotto-time [LINK HERE] to predict the export volumes using a generalized autoregression model. 

## Getting started

conda create python=3.7 --name time -y
conda activate time
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
